This project is a PHP port of the momentkh JavaScript library:
Original momentkh library: https://github.com/ThyrithSor/momentkh
Original Author: ThyrithSor (https://github.com/ThyrithSor)
Original License: MIT License

The algorithms and calculations used in this library are based on:
- "Pratitin Soryakkatik-Chankatik 1900-1999" by Mr. Roath Kim Soeun
- Traditional Khmer calendar system
- References from cam-cc.org and dahlina.com

Special thanks to ThyrithSor for making Khmer calendar calculations accessible 
to developers through the original momentkh library.
